* translate hook async, to allow node-style "if .cs file name, load coffeescript transpiler" sort of thing?

* Is there an factory sequence issue because .depend is async? Does it matter as far as cycle resolution? Initial thought is no.
* how to handle recoverable errors, paths fallbacks? Maybe promises too opaque for that.
* In general, how to handle errors? Test they bubble correctly, get reflected in factorySequence correctly.



Test:

* throw an error in an overriden method, like translate.
