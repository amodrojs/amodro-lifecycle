* With no exports object defined get: Error: baz failed: TypeError: Cannot set property 'name' of undefined, but the trace is not usable. Perhaps instead of eval while in node, use vm, does that give good context?

* For addToRegistry: does local definition win over outer one?

* locate: pass in file extension? How would that work?

* try out parent/child relationship, make sure top is used for lifecycle hooks.

* packages config support: just put in a register for the package name pointing to main module, then a paths config?
* put in locations support from module as an override.
* bundles config, goes in locate



Test:

* throw an error in an overriden method, like translate.
